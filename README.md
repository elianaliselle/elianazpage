<div class="quote quote1">
Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet 
understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. 
It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for 
less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses. 
<br>- Ann Landers

<div class="quote quote2">
Love is the most important thing in the world, but baseball
is pretty good too. 
<br>- Yogi Berra

<div class="quote quote3">
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not 
boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not 
self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of 
wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
<br>- Paul the Apostle
