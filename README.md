<div class="quote quote1">
Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
<br>- 1 John 4:8
</div>

<div class="quote quote2">
A new command I give you: 
  Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 
  By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.
<br>- John 13:34-35
</div>

<div class="quote quote3">
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not 
boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not 
self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of 
wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
<br>- Paul the Apostle
